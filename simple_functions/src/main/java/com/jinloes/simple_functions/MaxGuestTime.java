/**
 * Consider a big party where a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times is maintained.
 * Find the time at which there are maximum guests in the party. Note that entries in register are not in any order.
 * Example :
 * <p>
 * Input: arrl[] = {1, 2, 9, 5, 5}
 * exit[] = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}
 * First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4,
 * second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.
 * <p>
 * Output: 5
 * There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.
