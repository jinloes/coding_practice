How would you design the data structures for a very large social network like FaceÂ­ book or LinkedIn?
Describe how you would design an algorithm to show the shortest path between two people
(e.g., Me -> Bob -> Susan -> Jason -> You).

Considerations
    - people will be related in some way so a graph structure makes sense

Shortest Path Algorithm
    - BFS approach
        - queue up neighbors
        - if neighbor != person looking for

Scaling
    - All the data cannot be kept in one machine
        - may have to go to other machines for the user's data
            - Look up where Bob's data live and pull it
            - Only have the id stored locally
    - Batch up lookups on machines
    - Think about geographically locating data near each other
        - Reduces amount of look ups needed
    - Can store the paths to users to speed up look up time in the future
